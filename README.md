# Pac-Man Game 
The game is designed to be played by one player, who takes control of the Pac-Man character as it moves through a maze, collecting pellets and avoiding enemies. The player can move Pac-Man using the arrow keys on their keyboard, and the game is won when all pellets in the maze have been collected.
The Java implementation of the Pac-Man game uses various Java libraries to render the graphics and handle the user input. The code is organized into different classes, such as the Pac-Man class, the Enemy class, and the Board class, to make the code easier to read and maintain.
